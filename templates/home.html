    We have over 20 years in preparing both online and paper profiles, 
    coupled with international recruitment in mining, engineering, IT 
    and technical industries. This gives us valuable insight how to 
    make you stand out from the crowd. You only have a very short 
    window of opportunity to make an impression, to get a recruiter 
    to take a further look.

<h3>Your Profile is your Ambassador...</h3>

    In this digital age, crowded with social media, you need to 
    own the first page of Google. When someone types your name 
    in Google, all the results on the first page should be pointing 
    to you.  In a good way. Potential employers will Google you 
    before they make contact.  A complete and well written <em>LinkedIn 
    profile</em> will rank higher in search results than one with minimum 
    information.

    What comes up when you type your name in Google?  Where do you rank?

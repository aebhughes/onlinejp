<h1 id="the-importance-of-a-linkedin-profile">The importance of a LinkedIn profile</h1>
<p>Who really needs a LinkedIn profile, anyway? Is it not just a lot of effort for something that just, in the end, a waste of time?</p>
<p>Not so much. Not at all, in fact.</p>
<p>LinkedIn is how recruiters and headhunters source all their candidates today, especially passive candidates. Passive candidates are those that are not actively on the job market but would entertain being approached. The best people recruiters find are often passive candidates.</p>
<p>Who would <em>not</em> want to be approached, to be found and introduced to better and greater opportunities? Without an effective LinkedIn profile that can be searched by recruiters, you will remain invisible to them.</p>
<p>A LinkedIn account is more than just a place to find work. It is an excellent networking tool. LinkedIn has over 340 million users, of which 40% actively log on every day. Every one of that 40%, or 136 million active users, have over 500 connections each. With this sort of coverage, your network coverage is largely automatic.</p>
<p>Why network? What is the point? What are the benefits?</p>
<p>Networking in your industry is how you get noticed, recognised and rewarded. Networking gives you the right sort of exposure by telling a huge and interested audience who you are and what you are about.</p>
<p>Unlike other social networks, negative exposure is all but eliminated by LinkedIns' strict usage policies. Unwelcome approaches from scammers and the like are quickly blocked and seldom happen.</p>
<p>Having a large network is an invaluable asset. Even if you feel you do not need it now, it will prove useful in the future. Start now, it takes time to build up a network. Be prepared, be active and stay in touch.</p>
<p>Develop your profile. Join industry groups and interest groups. Share your opinion and publish your work. Promote your abilities. Build your network and reap the rewards.</p>
